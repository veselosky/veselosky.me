# Natural Laws

I figure any phrase that people deem to be a "law" and find important
enough to attribute to a specific person (even if incorrectly) probably
contains some real wisdom. Here's a collection of [Eponymous Laws][]
from Wikipedia, all of which I have found to be true in my own
experience.

Amara's Law: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the
short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

Conway's Law: Any organization that designs a system will inevitably
produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's
communication structure.

Gall's Law:

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a
simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be
true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be
made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple
system.

Parkinson's law: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its
completion.

Law of the Instrument or Maslow's Golden Hammer: It is tempting, if the
only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a
nail.

Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you
take into account Hofstadter's Law. (I've also heard this restated as
"Every task takes longer and costs more than originally estimated.")

Occam's razor – "Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter
necessitatem." Literally, entities are not to be multiplied without
necessity. When two explanations are offered for a phenomenon, the
simplest full explanation is preferable. (Or in modern terms: Keep It
Simple, Stupid!)

Pareto principle – 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.

Schneier's law – Any person can invent a security system so clever that
she or he can't think of how to break it.

Sturgeon's law – Ninety percent of everything is crap.
