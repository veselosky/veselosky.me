The Real Value of Social Media is its Weakness
========================================================

Many still doubt the utility of social media. I myself was among the doubters
until I was forced onto Twitter and Facebook to test the social media
integration for a web site I was developing. That’s when I discovered that,
although `Sturgeon’s Law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s%20Law>`_
applies to social media as much as anything else, the small percentage of “good
stuff” is exceedingly valuable.

Case in point is this article: `In a pinch, Twitter found a long shot source |
By Daniel Victor <http://bydanielvictor.com/2010/01/11/in-a-pinch-twitter-found-a-longshot-source/>`_. Stuck playing catch up on a story on a Sunday
evening, with deadline looming, journalist Daniel Victor turned to Twitter in a
last ditch search for sources. Long story short, Twitter came through for him.

The value of social networking tools like Twitter and Facebook is not
immediately obvious to some (it wasn’t to me), and may even be counter
intuitive. I’ve heard complaints that it’s difficult or impossible to form deep
relationships through digital media, and `Luddite`_ sentiment that we should
turn back to “face time” in our relationships. I disagree with the idea that
deep relationships cannot be formed online, but the real value of social media
is not in the deep relationships. It’s in the `weak ties`_.

According to network theory, it’s the weak ties in a social network that
transfer the most value (by social network here we are not talking about the
online space, but connections between people however they are formed and
maintained). Those to whom we are closely connected obviously are valuable to us
for personal reasons, but when it comes to economic value, it’s the casual
acquaintances who add the most value.

When you are looking for a job, a client, a customer, it is the people in the
periphery of your network who can connect you to valuable resources you would
not otherwise have found. A former co-worker has a cousin who is looking for
someone with just your skills, that sort of thing. `Malcolm Gladwell`_ called
these people *connectors*, because they move in and out of many circles, cross-
pollinating them like a (forgive the phrase) social butterfly.

The power of social media technologies is that they grease the proverbial skids.
Using these new tools, we can all become connectors. The technology enables us
to manage a larger number of weak ties than `Dunbar`_ would otherwise permit,
thereby increasing the size and theoretical value of our personal network. You
might only “know” a hundred people in “real life”, but your network on Twitter
and LinkedIn might contain 500 links or more. And while all those folks won’t
come to your sister’s wedding, at least a few would be happy to connect you to a
local political operator to help you with a story for your paper, as Daniel
Victor discovered.

The true value of social media is not the strong connections it enables, but the
weak ones.
