You can stop holding your breath! [Shifting Loyalties: The Piero Codex Book Two][1]
has been released! (Okay, I know you weren't really holding your breath, but I
was!) This is my second novel, as well as being the second book in The Piero
Codex series.

I'm excited to introduce shape-shifters into the Seers Guild world with this
release. You have some new characters to meet (including the mysterious ex,
Marina), some secrets of the Codex itself will be revealed, and Mack is going to
get into a whole new mess of trouble! This second installment has more action,
more magic, more pages, and possibly more bourbon (I didn't count the drinks).
Trust me, it's even better than the first one!

If you pre-ordered the book, you should have it on your reading gizmo already.
If you didn't, hit your favorite ebook retailer and grab it today (links below
for your convenience)!

I'm currently hard at work writingÂ Summoning Courage: The Piero Codex Book
Three to wrap up this trilogy. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy reading
Shifting Loyalties!
