<a href="https://vince.veselosky.me/seers-guild/cursing-fate">Cursing Fate: The
Piero Codex Book One</a>, is now available for pre-order on most major ebook
retailers! This is the first book in my urban fantasy thriller series, The Piero
Codex. Books two and three will follow quickly in a rapid release schedule, so
don't worry, you won't have to wait long to read the whole trilogy.

I am unspeakably excited that my first book is finally available to the world.
In fact, I'm so excited that you can call me Giveaway Bob, because <em>I'm
giving them away</em>!
