Barb from <a href="http://coverinked.com">CoverInked</a> really stepped up her
game on this cover, don't you think?

When it’s a matter of life and death, how do you know who to trust?

Mack was never good at trusting people, even before he went underground hiding
from the Seers Guild. But when the former love of Mack’s life (Marina) goes
missing, and an unknown organization makes dramatic moves against the Protectors
of the Piero Codex, he needs help.<!--more-->

Maybe he can trust Recca, but she still seems to have a hidden agenda of her
own. Maybe he can trust Lilly, but will involving her just get her killed? Maybe
he can trust Marina’s husband Richard, but how is he supposed to work with the
guy who stole his girlfriend?

With the enemy closing in, and time running out, turning an enemy agent seems
like the best option. But when you can’t even trust your friends, how do you
trust an enemy? Even if he manages to make all the right choices, how is Mack
going to convince the other players to trust <em>him</em> long enough to save
Marina and protect the Codex?

This second installment in The Piero Codex series takes you deeper into the
world of seers, and reveals some of the secrets of the Codex itself! Get it
today! (Pre-orders will be delivered June 14, 2018.)
