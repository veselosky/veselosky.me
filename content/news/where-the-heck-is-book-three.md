I know what you're thinking. Didn't Vince say he was going to give me the
conclusion to The Piero Codex trilogy in July? Where is it already?

Well, have you ever heard that quote about where the best laid plans often go?
Yeah. Summoning Courage WAS planned to ship in July, but as it stands today, the
draft is only about half complete. I'm working on it and making steady progress,
but the muse and I are having disagreements that have slowed things down. Give
me another couple of months to iron out the kinks, m'kay?

But I would hate for you to have nothing to read for all that time! If your "to
read" queue is looking a little dry, let me give you a recommendation to tide
you over. Since you enjoy my books, I feel pretty confident that you will love
Dana Cameron's <a href="https://amzn.to/2mFrw7B">Seven Kinds of Hell</a>, the
first book in her <a href="https://amzn.to/2A6Q6bn">Fangborn series</a>. It has
a lot of the elements you love: dark magics, secret societies, ancient relics,
and a fresh take on the "vampires and werewolves" concept. I encourage you to
check it out!

In future, you can always check out the new <a
href="https://vince.veselosky.me/recommended-reading">Recommended Reading</a>
page on my site. I will update it as I discover new books I think you will like.
(Got a recommendation of your own? Just let me know!)

Finally, I'm also selling some used books from my site. Check out the current
inventory of <a href="https://vince.veselosky.me/douglas-adams">Douglas
Adams</a> and <a href="https://vince.veselosky.me/terry-pratchett">Terry
Pratchett</a> books for sale.
