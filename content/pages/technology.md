As a systems architect, I spend a lot of time thinking about systems in
technology. A "system" in IT can sometimes refer to a single computer, but I am
always thinking about systems as larger organizations of multiple computers, or
more interestingly, processes running on computers. Orchestrating cooperative
systems across a fluctuating network of computers is one of the most interesting
IT issues today.
