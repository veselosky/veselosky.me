title: Why News Archived Behind Paywall Fails
---

One business model for online news that has been suggested, [tried, and
failed](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/media/18times.html),
is to make the news free for some short time, and then archive it behind
a pay-wall. There is more than one reason why this doesn’t work as a
business model, but the most obvious one is an old adage that should
have been well known in the newspaper industry: **yesterday’s news wraps
today’s fish.**

It should not come as a surprise that it is hard to find people willing
to pay good money for yesterday’s news, especially in the age of 24 hour
TV news and instant digital dissemination over the Internet. Old news
does have value to historians and researchers, but only after it has
faded from the collective memory, decades after the fact. In the space
between breaking news and historical research, the value of that content
becomes nearly impossible to extract.

Placing news articles behind the pay-wall also fails for another reason:
it breaks the web. Rather, it is counter to the way the web works.

Web pages accumulate links, which are crawled by search engines, raising
the relative “value” of that page in search algorithms. The more links
you have to your content, the more likely that your content will get
significant traffic from search results. Content hidden behind a
pay-wall cannot easily accumulate links, and visitors from search
engines may find only a barrier page demanding payment rather than the
content they were actually searching for. The chance of that visitor
reaching for his credit card is much lower than the chance that she will
hit the Back button and move on to the next (free) site in the search
results.

Certainly there are successful business models where people pay for
access to information. Online news archives, however, are more valuable,
both to their creators and their consumers, when they are visible to
search engines and available at no charge.
