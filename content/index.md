Systems Architect, Web Applications
===================================

Hello! I'm Vince Veselosky, a systems architect and builder of web
applications. In my career I have focused on software systems, but I am
interested in dynamic systems of all types, especially complex adaptive
systems. I love the media business, because multi-sided markets are
complex systems by nature.

My career has given me the opportunity to play many roles in the course
of technical product development, including software developer, solution
architect, and product manager. No matter the role, I *always* place my
emphasis on great customer service. My manager, my peers, and my
employees are customers too.

As a software developer, I have built large-scale web applications in
Python, and before that in Perl. I have also toyed with Ruby, PHP,
JavaScript, and Go. So far I have managed to avoid Java, but "cool" JVM
languages like Groovy, Scala, and Clojure are on my list of things to
do.

As an architect, I have built communication bridges between business and
technology, providing solution designs in the form of diagrams and prose
documents which facilitate shared understanding of the business goals
and product design.

As a "product owner" in Agile parlance, I have broken down projects into
epics and stories, written user stories and acceptance criteria,
prioritized backlogs, assisted with estimation, and contributed to
project planning.

As a product manager, I have consulted with customers to generate
strategic roadmaps, tracked and prioritized feature requests, managed
customer support and communications, and focused on business outcomes
over technology checklists.
