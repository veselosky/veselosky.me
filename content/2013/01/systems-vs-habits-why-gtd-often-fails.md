In my [previous post][], I wrote about David Allen's [Getting Things
Done][] book and productivity system. If GTD has a weakness, it is that,
although the book describes the system very well, it does a poor job of
describing the change of daily habits you'll have to perform if
you really want to implement the system. The major reason people fail at
implementing a GTD-style productivity system in their lives is that, no
matter how simple the system may be, it's a big change from what they
are used to.

Leo Babauta is a self-made expert in changing and forming habits. His
[Zen Habits blog][] has changed the lives of many of its readers. So
when I decided to try getting organized once again, there were two books
on my reading list: David Allen's (the System), and Leo Babauta's [Zen
To Done][], Leo's personal take on productivity.

## On Habits and Willpower

I like to think of habits as irrigation ditches. 

If you are a farmer who wants your fields watered, the obvious thing to
do is to go get some water. But carrying buckets of water from the well
to your field is inefficient and places a low upper limit on the amount
of crop you can grow effectively. The effective farmer instead spends
his effort digging irrigation ditches. It's exhausting work, and at
first it seems to generate no benefit at all. But once the ditch is
complete, the water flows naturally into your fields on its own, without
effort.

Good habits are a way to automate your behavior the way irrigation
ditches automate watering. They allow you to accomplish work without
effort. But if you don't have them already, good habits can be hard to
form.

As humans, we have a natural aversion to change. The world and
activities that we are comfortable with got us this far, so they must be
good, right? Change might make things worse. So if your bar for success
is mere survival, aversion to change is probably a good thing. That's
why change makes us uncomfortable. It's instinctive.

Each of us has a limited ability to tolerate change. Too much change
makes us too uncomfortable, and we start to squirm, trying to avoid the
change, to get back in our comfort zone. The uncomfortable feeling we
get from too much change we call "stress". When we're trying to affect
change, we call the ability to tolerate it "willpower". But this is
misleading, because willpower must also be expended to tolerate change
that comes from the outside, change that we don't want.

Remember Steve McCroskey from [Airplane!][], the guy who picked the
wrong week to quit smoking? Too much change, he ran out of willpower.

Habits are a way to acclimate yourself to a new condition or activity,
so that you stop seeing it as stressful change and start seeing it as
normal.

## Habits and Productivity

GTD asks you to master five classes of activity:

-   Collect (everything in an Inbox, as few as possible)
-   Process (Empty the Inbox, Make decisions about where items go)
-   Organize (File and Schedule items & tasks)
-   Review
-   DO

But the GTD system itself doesn't tell you *how* to master these
activities. For most people, mastering these activities means forming at
least 4 new habits. For others it may require dozens of new habits to
master them. But forming habits requires willpower, and we only have so
much of that. The result is that many people trying to implement the
system as a whole feel overwhelmed by the change, and stop.

Zen To Done is a short ebook (there's also a [paperback][]) that
describes ten habits you can adopt to become fully productive. If even
ten habits sounds daunting and unachievable to you, don't worry, Babauta
has you covered. He describes a minimalist system that will yield major
improvements in productivity consisting of just four habits: Collect,
Process, Plan, and Do.

Babauta's approach to productivity is the same as his approach to
self-improvement. Break down the desired change into a set of behaviors
or habits, and tackle each habit one at a time before moving on to the
next. He has some quick tips and tricks in the book to help you form
these habits, but if you want to go deeper, you should probably read his
other book, [The Power of Less][], or page through the great free
content on his blog Zen Habits.

You should buy and read Zen To Done. It's cheap, it's an easy read, and
it may help you to make the changes you want in your life. But if you
don't, here's some friendly advice inspired by Babauta.

Give yourself permission to move slowly. Focus on just one habit, until
that one habit is mastered. This means there are several other habits in
your queue that are not "done" yet. You have to be okay with that. You
have to accept that first things come first, and trust that those other
things *will* get done. But for now, you must focus on the one thing you
have chosen. Remember, you aren't watering the fields quite yet. You are
still digging ditches.
