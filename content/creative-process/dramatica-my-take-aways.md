TL;DR: There is some genius in this theory, and possibly some madness. Every
writer should at least understand Dramatica's four through-lines, its definition
of character archetypes, and the two helpful concepts of character resolve and
story limit. If you go deeper, prepare to be confused.<!--more-->

The high-level concept in the Dramatica theory is that a story is a model of a
human mind attempting to solve a problem. A "complete story" is a story that
examines all possible solutions to a single problem.

Dramatica comes with a bundle of self-imposed caveats. It admits that it is a
theory that describes a certain kind of story. It also admits that a good story
structure doesn't necessarily lead to a good story, and there are plenty of
successful stories in the world with incomplete structures (according to the
Dramatica theory). Like several other popular story structure theories, it was
developed around Hollywood movies, and doesn't adapt perfectly to other
storytelling forms.

This theory is extremely complex. It invents a vocabulary all its own for
analyzing stories, which makes it difficult to absorb quickly. I'll be honest
and say up front, I don't have a deep understanding of it. If you want to go
deeper, see the resources at the end.

That said, this theory has some insights that I have found extremely valuable in
constructing and understanding stories. Here they are.

<h2>Dramatica's Four Through-Lines</h2>
Dramatica identifies four through-lines that intertwine to weave a complete
story.

<strong>The Overall Story Through-line</strong>: This is the "big picture"
story, the broad scope, or what I sometimes think of as the plot.

<strong>The Main Character Through-line</strong>: The story as seen through the
eyes of someone in it. The "main character" is the primary point-of-view
character, the person we expect the audience to most empathize or identify with.

<strong>The Influence Character Through-line</strong>: Also called the Impact
Character, the IC's perspective on the story is different from the main
character's. The IC attempts to influence the MC to change their perspective or
approach.

<strong>The Subjective Story Through-line</strong>: Also called the
Relationship, this is the relationship between the main and influence characters
in the context of the story.

Explicitly identifying these four through-lines makes it easy to see why some
stories seem to have no "heart." Those plot-driven stories focus on Overall
Story and give little attention to Character and Relationship.

The interplay of plot, character, and relationship is what makes stories really
stick. I like to say: Plot is what happens. Story is how your characters change
(or don't) because of what happens.

<h2>Character Resolve</h2>
Speaking of change, another extremely useful concept I picked up from Dramatica
is character resolve. In Dramatica the theory focuses on the Main Character
Resolve, assigning it either Change (the main character changes their
perspective or approach by the end) or Steadfast (the main character retains
their original perspective or approach at the end).

This part of the theory addresses what is normally called the character arc.
Arcs come in pairs, according to the theory. The Main and Influence character
have different approaches to the story problem. At the end of the story, one of
them must be proven right, and remain Steadfast, the other must be proven wrong
and Change.

There are a lot of story theorists who think that the main character must
change, even going so far as to define the main character as the one who
changes. Those theories never sat well with me. Dramatica's insight that a
character is tempted to change, but may remain steadfast, encompasses a much
more diverse set of great stories and dramatic possibilities.

While Dramatica primarily cares about the main character's resolve, it seems to
me that any character who has an arc must have a resolve, and probably needs to
have their own influence character to reflect the opposite resolve to make the
story feel complete.

<h2>Character Archetypes: Protagonist vs Main Character</h2>
Briefly, Dramatica identifies eight character archetypes: Protagonist,
Antagonist, Reason, Emotion, Sidekick, Skeptic, Guardian, and Contagonist. The
theory goes into great detail explaining how these archetypes are constructed,
and how they can be broken down to create more complex and interesting
characters. I can't do the theory justice in a short summary. Go check it out
for yourself.

The key insight that I found most useful here is the clear distinction
between the Protagonist (the driver of the Overall Story) and the Main
Character (the primary POV character).

According to the vocabulary of the theory, the Protagonist is the character
who pursues the Overall Story goal. The Main Character is the character the
audience most identifies with, the one through whose eyes we see. When these
two roles are played by the same character, they are called a Hero. This is
a common construction, but not the only one.

A more complex story can separate these roles into different characters. The
standard example is To Kill A Mockingbird, where the Main Character is young
Scout, but the Protagonist is Atticus Finch.

<h2>Story Limit</h2>
Finally, Dramatica helped me understand the concept of a story limit. You
have seen story limits in action stories where there is a literal ticking
clock. If the clock counts down to zero, the hero loses! The ticking clock
is called a Time Limit. It's so prevalent that Story Grid creator Shawn
Coyne assigned an entire sub-genre to it.

Dramatica clued me that there is another kind of story limit: the Option
Limit. This is where the story is given finite scope by allowing limited
options: three wishes, and then you're done.

The story limit is the thing that adds dramatic tension to your story and
compels the characters to move forward. Without a story limit, stories can
just meander on and on, reaching no conclusion, or characters can sit around
indefinitely without moving the story forward at all.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
Dramatica also has some interesting things to say about act structure,
showing how two, three, and four act structures can be derived from the
value shifts among the four through-lines and how they are distributed
through the story. There's much, much more to Dramatica; too much for me to
wrap my head around.

I have found that story limit, character resolve, and the four through-lines
have been excellent tools for me to apply in the construction of stories.
