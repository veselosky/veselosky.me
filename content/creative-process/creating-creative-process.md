title: Creating a Creative Process

I always aspired to being an author. In my teens and early twenties, I probably
started a half-dozen "first novels" that never got finished (and that was
probably for the best). When I started writing software, though, that became my
creative outlet, and I stopped writing fiction. I even stopped reading fiction
for many years.

In 2015, I decided to pick up that dream once again, and I determined to set
myself to finishing a first novel. I dusted off some old ideas, tossed in
some new twists, and began putting words down.

And I quickly realized that it wasn’t going to work.

All writers have a process (I’ve heard). Some writers are "discovery"
writers or "pantsers," who begin with a character or situation and discovery
the story as they write it, "by the seat of the pants".

I am not one of these writers. What I learned after ten thousand words or
so, was that I needed a structured process. I am an outliner. And my outline
was not strong enough to hang the writing on. I got stuck.

So I hung up the dream of finishing my novel during 2015’s NaNoWriMo, and
resolved to take a more disciplined approach.

Currently I’m using a process similar to the one I use to create software.
I’ve laid down the essential elements as cards in Scrivener: the main
themes of the story, key scenes, major events. I arranged the events
chronologically, and began to break down the story into acts, chapters, and
beats. I’ve heard television writers talk about "breaking" a story in
exactly this way to create an episode. That must be a much harder task for
television writers, where the acts need to be strictly timed and fairly
uniform in size. Fortunately (or unfortunately?) a novelist has a bit more
freedom.

As I began to visualize my story outline this way, I discovered major
problems. First, a huge amount of the action was bunched up at the
beginning. The entire middle was empty of any significant action. And there
was no bridge from that empty middle to the resolution.

This is where Scrivener helped me a lot as a tool. Since all my scenes were
tucked into these nice index cards, I started to shuffle them. I broke up
that tight cluster of cards at the beginning and started to distribute them
into the middle chapters. Then, realizing that there was still a huge empty
space where the second act was supposed to be, I knew I needed to add a
major subplot there to carry it forward.

With a strong outline, the process of actually laying down the words
becomes much cleaner for me. I know more or less exactly what it is I need
to say, and I can focus on the craft of how to say it. These are two
distinct tasks — determining the action, and describing the action — and
for me they require two different mindsets. Creating a detailed outline
helps me separate them.

This led me to the (re)discovery that building the story and telling
the story are two very different things. As a writer, I need to
understand the chronology of the entire arc, and the back story, and
(in my case) the future story as well. Since I am writing fantasy and
building a world, I have history and cultures to flesh out also.

But not all these facts will be revealed directly to the reader. Some
things that chronologically happen at the beginning won’t be revealed
to the reader until the end (that’s the definition of a mystery, isn’t
it?). Some of it is backstory or background color that will be
sprinkled into the middle, as characters talk about their past
(off-screen) interactions.

I’m finding that, if I’m going to do anything interesting in the
telling of the story (mysteries, flashbacks, parallel timelines) I
actually need two outlines: one a timeline of events that have
happened, for me to keep things straight, and the other an outline of
what gets revealed to the reader, the structure of the story. I haven’t
really figured out how to do that. Scrivener is great at the story
structure part, but it feels clunky using it for the author timeline. I
know there are some dedicated timelining tools out there. Maybe I
should look into them.

There’s plenty more I haven’t figured out. I know I need to mix
character beats with plot beats with world building info-dumps.
Currently I’m still "pantsing" that, and I don’t feel like it’s very
effective. I would like to be more deliberate about exposing the world
building and character stuff in the outline, instead of painting it
haphazardly onto the plot as I write. On the other hand, a lot of those
things don’t come up until I’m in the character’s head in the moment,
and I’m like, wait, she’s writing a letter, but was there even a post
office in the middle ages? How DID they deliver the mail? And is she
sad, or relieved, that she doesn’t have a husband during this trial?

It took me many years to learn how to build software well. Doubtless,
it will take years for me to reach journeyman level in the fiction
craft as well.
