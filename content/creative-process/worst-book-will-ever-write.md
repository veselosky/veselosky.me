title: The Worst Book I Will Ever Write
published: 2016-11-05

Something I have been struggling with during the work on my (current) first
novel is this: I am very likely producing the _worst_ book I will ever write.

Assuming I finish it — which given past history is not a foregone conclusion —
suppose I find the whole thing too exhausting to do again? Having written only
one, it would, by default, be the worst one (and the best I suppose). If I go on
to write the second, I should have learned much from writing the first, and the
writing should improve. Skills are supposed to improve with practice, are they
not? So I am destined to look back on this book and recognize how _bad_ it is.

But there’s no getting around that. It was the same thing when I was learning to
write computer software. Every six months, I would look back on my code from six
months prior, and be disgusted by how bad it was. Most programmers recognize
this feeling. It’s how we know we’re getting better. If ever we look back on old
code and feel satisfied with it, it’s a sign that we’ve stagnated, and maybe
it’s time to look for a different career. Have you considered middle management?

I expect I will find writing the same. I will struggle to do my best with each
succeeding story. And every time I look back, I will be sickened at how badly I
botched it. But I will be determined to take my lessons learned to make the next
one better. And if ever I look back on a story I’ve written and feel fully
satisfied with it? That will be the sign that I’m done writing, I guess.
