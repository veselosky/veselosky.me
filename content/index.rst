Systems Architect, Web Applications
============================================================

Hello! I'm Vince Veselosky, a systems architect and builder of web applications.
In my career I have focused on software systems, but I am interested in dynamic
systems of all types, especially complex adaptive systems. I love the media
business, because multi-sided markets are complex systems by nature.

My career has given me the opportunity to play many roles in the course of
technical product development, including software developer, solution
architect, and product manager. No matter the role, I *always* place my
emphasis on great customer service. My manager, my peers, and my employees are
customers too.

As a software developer, I have built large-scale web applications in Python,
and before that in Perl. I have also toyed with Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, and Go.
So far I have managed to avoid Java, but "cool" JVM languages like Groovy,
Scala, and Clojure are on my list of things to do.

As an architect, I have built communication bridges between business and
technology, providing solution designs in the form of diagrams and prose
documents which facilitate shared understanding of the business goals and
product design.

As a "product owner" in Agile parlance, I have broken down projects into epics
and stories, written user stories and acceptance criteria, prioritized
backlogs, assisted with estimation, and contributed to project planning.

As a product manager, I have consulted with customers to generate strategic
roadmaps, tracked and prioritized feature requests, managed customer support
and communications, and focused on business outcomes over technology
checklists.
